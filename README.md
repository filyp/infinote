## Instalation

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv --copies
venv/bin/pip install PySide6 pynvim colormath
```

## Troubleshooting

If program hangs during opening, check if vim can open your .md notes. There may be some lingering swap files that you'll need to delete. Or simply copy your note folder to a new location and see if it opens there.
